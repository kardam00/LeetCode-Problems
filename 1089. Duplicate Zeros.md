# **1089. Duplicate Zeros**

Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1**
> Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
> 
> Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
>
> Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

**Example 2**
> Input: arr = [1,2,3]
>
> Output: [1,2,3]
>
> Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
 
**Constraints**
>* 1 <= arr.length <= 104
>* 0 <= arr[i] <= 9

```

    def duplicateZeros(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.

        b = False
        for i in range(len(arr)-1):

                temp = arr[i+1]
                arr[i+1] = 0

            else:
                b = False
        return arr
